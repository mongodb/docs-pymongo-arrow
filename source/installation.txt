In this guide, you can learn how to install and upgrade {+driver-short+}.

System Compatibility
--------------------

{+driver-short+} is regularly built and tested on macOS and Linux
(Ubuntu 20.04).

Python Compatibility
--------------------

{+driver-short+} is compatible with CPython versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

Installation
------------

You can install **{+driver-short+}** in three ways:

- Pip 
- Conda
- From source

Install with Pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using pip to install {+driver-short+} on all platforms.
{+driver-short+} is available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow

To get a specific version of pymongo:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow==1.0.1

To upgrade using pip:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   $ python -m pip install --upgrade pymongoarrow

.. important:: 

   If the install fails because of an error, such as ``ValueError: Could
   not find "libbson-1.0" library``, it means that ``pip`` failed to find a
   suitable wheel for your platform. We recommend first ensuring you have
   ``pip`` >= 20.3 installed. To upgrade ``pip``, run the following shell command:

   .. code-block:: python

      $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

You can then try to re-install ``pymongoarrow``.

We currently distribute wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux on x86_64
architectures.

Install with Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMongoArrow is available for ``conda`` users by running the following shell
command:

.. code-block:: python

   $ conda install --channel conda-forge pymongoarrow

Install from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the above options still do not allow you to install ``pymongoarrow`` on your
system, you can install from source. To learn how, see the `Contributing Guide
<https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow/blob/main/bindings/python/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source>`__.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

{+driver-short+} requires the following:

- PyMongo>=4.4
- PyArrow>=13,<13.1

To use {+driver-short+} with a PyMongo feature that requires an optional
dependency, users must install PyMongo with the dependency manually.

.. note:: 

   PyMongo's optional dependencies are detailed
   `here <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies>`__.

For example, to use {+driver-short+} with Client-Side Field Level Encryption,
you must install PyMongo with the ``encryption`` option in addition to installing
{+driver-short+}:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install 'pymongo[encryption]' pymongoarrow

Applications intending to use {+driver-short+} APIs that return query result-sets
as ``pandas.DataFrame`` instances, such as ``~pymongoarrow.api.find_pandas_all()``,
must also have ``pandas`` installed:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pandas
